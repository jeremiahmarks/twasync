#Part 4 - notes

**Note:  Do not use any of this stuff in actual production code.**

**It uses low level API stuff that simply should not be used in production**

Notes regarding twisted-client-1/get-poetry.py

* Creates poetrySocket object
* this is basically just a fancy socket connection to an address
* the interesting parts of its __init__ statement:  

=============  
    self.address = address
    self.sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
    self.sock.connect(address)
    self.sock.setblocking(0)
* It basically access the socket, connects to the remote address and then turns blocking off
* Finally the init statement imports the reactor and adds itself to the reactor using reactor.addReader(self)

##Interfaces

* principle purposes of Interfaces is documentation

**Note:  Duck Typing:**

> the type of an object is principally defined not by its position in a class hierarchy but by the public interface it presents to the world. Thus two objects which present the same public interface (i.e., walk like a duck, quack like a â€¦) are, as far as duck typing is concerned, the same sort of thing (a duck!).

* we say that a class implements an interface and instances of that class provide the interface 

The addReader method does not have a self parameter. because
it is solely concerned with defining a public interface, and 
the self argument is part of the implementation. **Interface
objects are never instantiated or used as base classes for real
implementations**

IReadDescriptor.doRead()  
- reads data from the socket asynchronously when called from reactor

** doRead is really a callback, but instead of passing it 
directly to Twisted, we pass in an object with a doRead 
method**

**Common in twisted -  instead of passing a function you pass an object that must provide a given Interface.**
